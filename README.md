# Grade-12-Final-Project
The task of this project was to make any type of program that implemented parts of the curriculum. I decided to make a top-down shooter game in Java it was based off the game The Binding of Isaac. I followed many tutorials on my own time to complete this assignment. If I were to do this assignment again I would do it a lot differently and make it more mechanically fun.
